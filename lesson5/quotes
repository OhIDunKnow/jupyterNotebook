Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
Art is never finished, only abandoned.
Learning never exhausts the mind.
The smallest feline is a masterpiece.
Water is the driving force of all nature.
Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence.
The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.
He who does not punish evil, commands it to be done.
Poor is the pupil who does not surpass his master.
Our life is made by the death of others.
